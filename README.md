# SkillAndGrace
Rimworld mod to add a configurable grace period before skill degradation occurs

# Installing 
Copy the entire 'SkillAndGrace' folder in the repo root to the Rimworld\Mods folder

Will make a proper release and Steam Workshop at some point maybe

# Compiling
A visual studio solution is set up, but it requires a folder 'External' to be added to the root, with the 'Assembly-CSharp.dll' and 'UnityEngine.dll' copied from RimWorld
